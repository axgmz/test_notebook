## Running

DeePMD training (even if it is unrealistically simplified) in `1-DeePMD/1-Short_training/` takes 15 min

Lammps MD run (very short 1 ps trajectory) in `2-MD/1-Short_MD_run/` needs 25 min to finish

Please note it may be useful to kill the kernel of an analysis notebook after closing it to save some memory. You can do that in the second menu on the left "Running Terminals and Kernels": terminate the kernels that are no longer necessary.

## Improvements

- Lower-level DeePMD model (no smooth edition?) to decrease training time and memory usage
- MD with only 64 water molecules
